# Cypress Mess
This is a bad example of Cypress testing

### Prerequisites:

- Node 18 and NPM

### Running the Exercise 
To get started these commands should get the tests running:

- `npm install` - Install all dependencies
- `npm test` - Run the Cypress E2E tests which can be found in the `/cypress/e2e/todo` folder

If you want to run the app without executing the tests you can run `npm start` and navigate to
[localhost:8080/app/todo](http://localhost:8080/app/todo) (You may need to change the port if you're running other local applications)
